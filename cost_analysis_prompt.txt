Given a client’s project profile and current cloud bill, generate a JSON-only cloud cost analysis and optimization report aligned with the customer’s budget and requirements.

The output **must include**:-
1. Total monthly cost, which must lie within [input_total_monthly_cost − 10,000, input_total_monthly_cost + 10,000]
2. Cost breakdown by service
3. Budget and budget variance
4. Over/under budget status
5. 6–10 actionable cost-optimization recommendations

**Important Constraints**:-
1. Return JSON only (no text outside JSON).
2. Recommendations must be multi-cloud, covering AWS, Azure, GCP, and open-source/free-tier options where applicable.
3. Do not double-count savings:
4. If multiple recommendations target the same service, assume they are mutually exclusive.
5. For savings aggregation, consider only the maximum feasible saving per service.
6. Total potential savings must never exceed total monthly cost.
7. Savings percentage must be capped at 100%.

**Implicit Calculation Rules** (must be followed):-
1. total_monthly_cost = sum(service_costs)
2. budget_variance = total_monthly_cost − budget
3. total_potential_savings = sum(max savings per service)
4. savings_percentage = min((total_potential_savings / total_monthly_cost) × 100, 100)
